Pls download and install the 3 modules from the Refs file (Urisina, Numpy, and a Solving alg) or run the setup file from the build folder

Unzip the UNZIP file and move all the folders out into the main folder with all the other python files (this is the models and textures)

Right click end edit the menus file in an editor of your choice

Line 300 of the menus file has an example state to be solved (currently commented out) if you can't or do not want to enter your own cube state, just press solve when you get the input menu and it should display it (if you uncommented it)

Run through the editor you are using
